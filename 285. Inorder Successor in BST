285. Inorder Successor in BST

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.



The idea is equivalent to doing binary search on a BST
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        if (root == nullptr || p == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        TreeNode* res = nullptr;
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        while (cur != nullptr) {
            if (cur->val > p->val) {
                res = cur;
                cur = cur->left;
            } else {
                cur = cur->right;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
