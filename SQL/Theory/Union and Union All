UNION-ing data
UNION or UNION ALL have the same basic requirements of the data being combined:

There must be the same number of columns retrieved in each SELECT statement to be combined.
The columns retrieved must be in the same order in each SELECT statement.
The columns retrieved must be of similar data types.




We have seen that UNION and UNION ALL are useful to concatenate data sets and to manage whether or not we retain duplicates.
UNION performs a deduplication step before returning the final results, UNION ALL retains all duplicates and returns the full, concatenated results.
To allow success the number of columns, data types, and data order in each SELECT must be a match.
